/**
 * to do:
 * 


When you accelerate the ship, a small flame is animated.

Transient "dust" appears briefly when an asteroid splits or disappears.

Transient "debris" appears briefly when the ship is hit.

At level 2 an alien ship appears a few seconds into the level.  It follows a zig-zag path, periodically firing bullets in random directions.  
When it is destroyed, you earn 200 points.  A few seconds later, it appears again.

At level 3 and above the alien ship is smaller.  It fires directly at the ship.  Its destruction earns you 400 points.
